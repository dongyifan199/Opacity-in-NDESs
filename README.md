# Opacity-in-NDESs
Intro
----
This is a supplementary instruction for the paper "State-based Opacity Verification of Networked Discrete Event Systems Using Labeled Petri Nets".

The document entitled "Operations of MDDs and Matrix Diagrams" contains three definitions of the operations about multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) and matrix diagrams (union of two MDDs, union of two matrix diagrams, and relational product of an MDD and a matrix diagram).

We provide the text file "Supplementary Contents for NDESs" to add some extra contents for the paper. Particularly, Section 1 list key notations, Section 2 provides specific algorithms used in this paper as well as their detailed explanations and complexity analysis, and Section 3 replenishes some contents for the case study.
